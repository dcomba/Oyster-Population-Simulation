Our script simulates Eastern oyster (C. virginica) populations under different salinities and temperatures from three different sites across the Northern Gulf of Mexico (GOM) from early August 2017 through late September 2017. The three sites across south Louisiana have been assigned specific low salinity tolerances roughly based on data pulled from the literature (Jones et al in prep). Sites are named as follows: Vermillion Bay (VB), Calcasieu River (CR), and Caillou Bay (CB). The salinity and temperature data for these sites for August-September 2017 was obtained from the USGS Current Conditions webpage which contains a database of environmental conditions collected by bouys along the coast. Data was collected every 0.5hours meaning there are 48 data points (or "time points") per day. 

As global temperatures rise, more intense storms such as Harvey or Superstorm Sandy develop. As climate change continues to reshape our world, it is crucial to understand how biological populations respond to catastrophes. C. virginica is of particular interest as it is a vital part to Louisiana's economy. The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries states that, “Louisiana’s commercial oyster industry, which accounts for almost 4,000 jobs, has an economic impact of $317 million annually.” During the months chosen (August-September 2017) Hurricane Harvey developed in the GOM resulting in lower salinities across the Northern GOM due to increased rainfall. C. virginica are osmoconformers and as temperature increases, they have a harder time acclimating to lower salinities. From this phenomenon we can see a synergistic effect of high temperature and low salinity on C. virginica populations.
